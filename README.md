### Advent of Code

Solvers for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

#### Files

- `inputs/` contains test and full inputs for each day. Full inputs are
  gitexcluded, so you'll need to download them using the `get_inputs.py`
  script.
- `solvers/` contains solvers for each day. Different languages have their
  own subdirectories.
- `solutions/` contains solutions for my inputs. They're different for
  different users, so don't copy them!
- `/.config` contains configuration files.

#### Execution

To run the solvers, run:

```sh
./run.py [-y <year>] [-d <day>] [-p <part>] [-i <implementation>] [-t]
```
