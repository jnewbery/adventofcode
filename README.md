#### Advent of Code

Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

- `inputs/` contains test and full inputs for each day. Full inputs are
  gitexcluded, so you'll need to download them using the `get_inputs.py`
  script.
- `solvers/` contains solvers for each day. Different languages have their
  own subdirectories.
- `solutions/` contains my solutions for each day. Yours won't be the same, so
  don't try to copy them!
